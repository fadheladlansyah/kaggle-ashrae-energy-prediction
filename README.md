Assessing the value of energy efficiency improvements can be challenging as there's no way to truly know how much energy a building would have used without the improvements. The best we can do is to build counterfactual models. Once a building is overhauled the new (lower) energy consumption is compared against modeled values for the original building to calculate the savings from the retrofit. More accurate models could support better market incentives and enable lower cost financing.

This competition challenges you to build these counterfactual models across four energy types based on historic usage rates and observed weather. The dataset includes three years of hourly meter readings from over one thousand buildings at several different sites around the world.

The data comes from over 1,000 buildings over a three-year timeframe. With better estimates of these energy-saving investments, large scale investors and financial institutions will be more inclined to invest in this area to enable progress in building efficiencies. ASHRAE, the host, serves to advance the arts and sciences of heating, ventilation, air conditioning refrigeration and their allied fields. ASHRAE members represent building system design and industrial process professionals around the world. With over 54,000 members serving in 132 countries, ASHRAE supports research, standards writing, publishing and continuing education - shaping tomorrowâ€™s built environment today.
